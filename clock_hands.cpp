/*

A standard circular wall clock has three hands (hours, minutes, seconds).
When do all three hands line up? Write a program to answer this question.
Your program should print the times of day (hh:mm:ss) when the 3 hands line up.

Assumptions:
    1. There are 60 evenly spaced ticks on the clock face.
    2. On each second:
        - The second hand rotates by one tick
        - The minute hand rotates by a fraction of a tick
        - The hour hand rotates by an even smaller fraction of tick
    3. Hands moves discretely and instantaneously.
       For example, the second hand will never be between two ticks.
    4. Hands are "lined up" when they are all within a full tick of each other.
